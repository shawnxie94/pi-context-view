# Context Usage view

`/context` and `/context usage` open **Context Usage**. Frame, color,
description, and interaction rules live in the [UI specification](../UI.md);
rules shared with Injections previews live in [previews.md](previews.md).

Three width tiers apply throughout:

- `SPACED_MAP_MIN_WIDTH` (72) columns and above: map cells have inter-cell
  spacing;
- `MAP_SIDE_BY_SIDE_MIN_WIDTH` (52) to 71 columns: the map renders without
  inter-cell spacing;
- below 52 columns (the narrow layout): the map, its key, and the zoom hint and
  label are hidden, and the selectable category list remains.

## Header and notices

At map widths, render the header as:

```text
Context Usage                         model · used/window (percent)
```

Omit the model completely if the full metadata does not fit; never abbreviate
it. Keep the usage summary right-aligned. In the narrow layout, hide the model
and render header, summary, and category heading flush at column 0, with one
blank row before and after the summary:

```text
Context Usage

used/window (percent)

Category:
```

While Fit scale is active, append the zoom label to the title with the shared
` · ` separator, dropping the model first:

```text
Context Usage · Zoom 1M → 120k        model · used/window (percent)
```

The label reads `Zoom window → scale` using the same token formatting as the
usage summary. If title and label still do not fit on one line, put them on
separate lines with one empty row before and after the label, as the Injections
header does. The label is absent at Window scale and in the narrow layout.

Do not append the redundant word `tokens` to Usage header or category-preview
summaries. Preserve `≈` when the usage total is estimated.

Non-fatal problems appear as `warning` notices between the header and the
dashboard, indented like other body content and wrapped to the width: the
degraded-capture reason first, then configuration problems such as ignored
entries. Sanitize every notice, since configuration text is untrusted. Cap the
block at `MAX_NOTICE_LINES` (3) rows; when notices do not fit, keep the rows
that fit and close with `… +N more`, counting the notices not shown in full.
They render here rather than through a notification, which the overlay hides.

## Current-context shares and overlapping views

Top-level category percentages use the live `ContextUsageSnapshot.estimatedTokens`
(sum of the top-level category estimates) as their denominator, so the root
shares normalize to approximately 100%. A nested row divides by its parent
category, not by the full context. A missing or zero estimate has no percentage;
never fabricate a share or render `NaN`. Context-window occupancy in the header,
map, buffer, and Free Space remains a separate measure.

After the category and window-occupancy rows, show a standalone `Agent Brain:`
section heading at the same visual level and heading style as `Category:` and
`Map:`. Keep `Auto-Compact Buffer` and `Free Space` within the Category section,
even though they describe window occupancy rather than composition shares.
Leave one empty row above the Agent Brain heading. Beneath it, show two
independently expandable groups: `Commands` and `Docs`. `Commands` expands
directly into one row per AB invocation, labeled with its safe CLI domain/verb
(for example `ab task get`); do not add a separate domain row or merge repeated
commands or multiple AB commands from one Bash call. `Docs` expands into skill
and Agent Brain document reads. Exclude unrelated tools and temporary documents,
and do not show cumulative provider totals or generation-wide failure/retry
counts here. The section heading itself is not a selectable data row.

Each command or document row carries its allocated share of tool-call arguments
and returned text, estimated by character length (roughly chars/4) and labeled
with `≈`. Child estimates sum exactly to their group total and reconcile with the
corresponding command or docs aggregate attribution; rounded `≈` labels may
visually differ slightly. On Enter, an AB invocation opens a timestamped `[bash]`
block preview and a Docs row opens timestamped `[read]` block(s), both initially
capped like Tool Output. Enter on a capped block reveals its full content.
Terminal-sanitize previews; raw command arguments, absolute document paths, and
returned text stay out of dashboard rows and persistent records. Derive these
details in memory from latest-request messages; persist only existing aggregate
counters. Percentages divide by the live category estimate when available.
Attribution may overlap category estimates and is not provider-reported total
usage.

The expanded groups use the existing Category viewport and scroll counter.
`/context history` and `/context failures` remain full-session cumulative views;
compaction scoping applies only to Usage accounting. Session custom entries stay
metadata-only, and opening any accounting view remains passive.

## Context map

The overview pairs a proportional map of `DEFAULT_MAP_SIZE` (16 × 16) cells by
default with an interactive category legend. Map geometry is an
input rather than a constant: derive the key, Block Size, and every layout
decision from the live geometry, and clamp a requested size to what the viewport
can render, so [Responsive rendering](../UI.md#responsive-rendering) always wins
over a requested size.

The configured `mapCols` and `mapRows` ([configuration
contract](../ARCHITECTURE.md#configuration)) request a size; each frame renders
the largest geometry that still fits:

- columns shrink until the legend keeps `MIN_DETAIL_WIDTH` (32) columns beside
  the map, counting the map indent and the spacing-tier column gap;
- rows shrink to the dashboard rows the terminal height leaves.

Clamping rebuilds the map at the smaller geometry instead of cropping cells, so
the visible map always maps the whole scale, and Block Size always describes the
rendered grid. The default size never clamps at any width that renders a map.

Cells use themed `■` for full occupancy, `◧` for partial occupancy, `▦` for
compacted data, `⛝` for the auto-compact buffer, and `⛶` for free space. Each
glyph follows its category color; buffer and free space are dim by default.
Allocate occupied cells from estimated category totals against the current map
scale, which is the context window unless [Fit](#map-scale) is active; display
pi-reported usage separately, because the values may differ.

A dedicated key appears beside the map, below the `Category:` and `Agent
Brain:` sections and their scroll counter, separated by one empty detail row:

```text
Map:
  ■ - Single category block
  ◧ - Shared block, largest category shown
  ⛶ - Block Size: 3.9k (0.4%)
```

Compacted, buffer, and free glyphs need no key row, because their category rows
identify them. Block Size is the mapped range divided by the cell count — the
map's resolution, or what the smallest visible cell is worth. Its percentage is
the cell's share of the mapped range, not of the context window, and both values
derive from live map geometry rather than an assumed grid size. Only the token
value follows the active scale: `muted` at Window, and the same `mdHeading`
treatment as the header's zoom label while Fit is active, so zooming visibly
shrinks and highlights it.

The key claims only the rows the complete legend leaves over, counted as the
detail column minus the `Category:` heading and every legend row, including the
`Agent Brain:` section heading:

- `MAP_KEY_DETAILED_SPARE_ROWS` (5) or more spare rows: the full key;
- `MAP_KEY_COMPACT_SPARE_ROWS` (2) to 4: the single-line
  `Map: ■ One category · ◧ Mixed · ⛶ 3.9k (0.4%)` key, dropping the percentage
  and then shortening `One category` to `One` before the line would truncate;
- fewer than 2: no key.

Only after the key is gone may the legend hide a category or telemetry row or
start scrolling, and the `Category:` heading with at least one legend row always
survives. The dashboard description collapses before the key degrades.

When auto-compaction is enabled, the tail of the map shows the settings
`reserveTokens` reserve as `⛝` cells after the free cells: tokens content will
never occupy because compaction triggers first. The buffer shrinks once
estimated content grows into the reserve, and disappears when auto-compaction is
disabled or settings are unreadable. Read the reserve from pi's merged
global/project settings at view-open time, honoring project trust and the
current model: `compaction.modelOverrides["<provider>/<id>"].reserveTokens`
wins over `compaction.reserveTokens`, which wins over pi's default. A model
switch changes the buffer on the next open. At Fit scale
the reserve lies past the mapped range, so no `⛝` cells render while the
`⛝ Auto-Compact Buffer` legend row remains.

## Map scale

The map has two scales, toggled by `z`: `Window` maps the full context window
and matches pi-reported fullness; `Fit` maps a smaller range so low occupancy
stays legible. Scale changes the denominator only — the map is always anchored
at token 0 and never pans, so no content falls outside it, and cell
classification, segment order, and the `■`/`◧` thresholds are unchanged.

Fit scale is the estimated occupied total plus headroom (`FIT_SCALE_PERCENT`,
115%), rounded up to a `FIT_SCALE_SIGNIFICANT_DIGITS` (2) boundary, floored at
`MINIMUM_FIT_SCALE_TOKENS` (10k) and capped at the context window. The headroom
keeps a visible band of `⛶` cells, so the map still reads as occupancy rather
than as a pure composition chart.

Render `Z Zoom` in the hint row directly before `Esc Close`. Hide the hint,
header label, and binding together whenever the toggle cannot help: in the
narrow layout, when the map is unavailable for lack of a context-window
denominator, or when the Fit scale would reach the context window. The view
opens at Window and holds the chosen scale only until it closes.

## Category legend

Each top-level category uses a configurable semantic theme color; built-in
defaults are distinct except for the intentionally shared System Prompt/Built-in
Tools color. A category override colors its map cells and legend marker, while
labels and values retain the shared selector styles. Buffer and free-space
overrides also color their map cells, legend markers, and Block Size key glyph.

Category names have no trailing colons. Fill the gap before values with `dim`
dot leaders; shorten or remove leaders before truncating labels or values. Token
and percentage values align in separate columns. Category shares use the live
estimated-token total (nested shares use the parent); buffer and Free Space
percentages continue to use the context window, regardless of map scale. Categories follow the order pi
assembles them into a request, and both views name them identically:

- System Prompt, Instruction Files, and Skills;
- Built-in Tools, Custom Tools, and MCP Tools;
- User Messages, Assistant Messages, Assistant Thinking, and Tool Calls;
- Tool Output and Extensions;
- Compacted Data and Free Space.

Extensions groups what extensions contributed outside their tool definitions:
one child per injected `customType`, plus one per source whose system-prompt
additions were attributed, named by that source. Those additions stay out of the
System Prompt total, which counts pi's own prompt alone.

Prefix each Tool Output breakdown row with a full-size `•` bullet rather than
the smaller middle dot `·`. Keep aggregate breakdowns collapsed except Tool
Output, whose per-tool results and bash executions appear directly and scroll
independently; map allocation always uses top-level totals. The trailing
`⛝ Auto-Compact Buffer` (when enabled) and `⛶ Free Space` rows directly follow
the last category, and Free Space excludes the buffer so all rows still sum to
the context window. Neither row has anything to preview: they scroll with the
legend but are skipped by cursor navigation.

When the legend overflows, show the dim `(current/total)` counter on the row
directly below the last visible legend row, indented two spaces, never beside
the `Category:` heading. It counts every legend row, including the trailing
buffer and free-space rows, and its left number is the last visible row, so
scrolling to the end reaches the total. Height-only resizing must also reflow
and clamp the viewport.

## Category preview

Render the selected category as chronological entries headed by:

```text
[DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM:SS] [breadcrumb…] tokens
```

Use dim for datetime and tokens, bold `mdHeading` for the first breadcrumb cell
naming the producing tool, message role, or skill, and muted for the rest.
Snapshot-backed categories omit datetime and retain category order. Assistant
messages split into constituent text, thinking, and tool-call entries; tool
calls include the tool name. Add a `text i/n` cell only for multi-block text or
thinking content.

### Thinking notation

Assistant Thinking entries carry an invisible-reasoning cell after the visible
estimate, with `T` as the visible-plus-invisible message total:
`+ Encoded ≈N (≈T)` for a provider-reported share on a message with a captured
signature, `+ Encoded ~N (~T)` for the signature-size proxy, and
`+ Reasoning ≈N (≈T)` without a captured signature. `≈` marks a
provider-reported count and `~` a rough proxy that must never be rendered as an
upper bound; omit zero-size shares.

Keep one wrapped dim explanation after the scrollable entries and before the
hints, opening with the schematic pattern
`[DD-MM-YYYY] [assistant] visible + Reasoning ≈invisible (≈total)` and then
defining `≈`, `~`, and `Encoded`; the per-block cap shrinks around it. Never
render, preview, or log raw signature bytes. [THINKING.md](../THINKING.md) owns
the estimate.

### Single-entry categories

When the selected category contains exactly one preview entry, including across
its children, Enter opens that entry's full, uncapped content directly. This
applies to every category, including System Prompt and individual Tool Output
rows, regardless of content length. Keep the category summary and entry identity
header, labeled parts, expanded marked JSON, skill badges, and the applicable
[marker legend](previews.md#marker-legend) or reasoning explanation. Token
estimates remain unchanged.

There is no selection gutter, block cap, hidden-line marker, or second Enter
level. Use the full-content scrolling keys and hints below, with a line-progress
counter only on overflow. Enter is a no-op; Escape returns directly to the same
category selection and legend viewport. Reopening any category starts its content
at the top. Width and height changes reflow and clamp the scroll position.

System Prompt's sections therefore form one continuous scrollable preview, not
selectable blocks. Omit its redundant `[System Prompt]` entry header and the
blank row after it: the category title already names the content and shows its
total. The body starts after the category header's single blank separator, and
the two reclaimed rows belong to the content viewport. Other categories retain
their entry identity headers.

### Blocks

For a category with multiple entries, treat each entry as one navigable block
with a two-column gutter before its header and content. Mark every line of the
selected block, including blank content lines, with an accent `┃`
(`BLOCK_GUTTER`); leave the blank separator
row between blocks unmarked. Unselected blocks keep the same spacing with no
gutter. When the stream overflows, show the selected block ordinal as a dim
`(i/n)` counter.

Up/Down and `k`/`j` move block by block, keeping the selected block fully
visible with minimal scrolling when it fits. If it is taller than the viewport,
expose its approached edge and scroll line by line within it before moving on.
PgUp/PgDn move by viewport height and select the first fully visible block,
falling back to the first intersecting block; once paging reaches the first or
last viewport, the next PgUp/PgDn selects the corresponding boundary block, so
paging alone reaches `(1/n)` and `(n/n)`. Home/End select the first or last
block.

Indent content two spaces after the gutter and separate blocks with one blank
row. An entry carrying labeled parts — a tool's prompt lines and definition, the
System Prompt's sections — renders them inside its own block under the
[labeled part rules](previews.md#labeled-parts), never as separate blocks, and
its entry header keeps the whole estimate. In User Messages only, replace
complete attached `<skill name="…">…</skill>` expansions with pi-colored
`[skill] name` badges and leave malformed wrappers visible; the full content
still contributes to token estimates.

### Block cap and full content

In a multi-entry stream, cap each block so two whole blocks stay visible: derive
the cap from terminal height and reserved footer rows — never from the viewport,
whose counter row depends on the capped stream — and clamp it between `PREVIEW_BLOCK_MIN_LINES`
(4) and `PREVIEW_BLOCK_MAX_LINES` (10) wrapped content lines. When content is
hidden, left-align a dim `… +N lines` marker with the block content; for the
selected block only, append dim ` · ` and accent `Enter - View Content`, never
repeated in the footer hint row. Fully visible blocks show no Enter action, and
Enter is a no-op for them.

Enter on a capped block opens a separate fullscreen level with the category
header, one blank separator row, the selected entry header, and its complete
uncapped content. That level uses line and page scrolling with
`↑↓/jk Scroll · PgUp/PgDn Page · Esc Back`, and Escape returns to the same block
and viewport. A category without entries instead shows
`No content captured for this category.` without a gutter; Enter is a no-op and
the hint row offers `Esc Back` alone. Unknown usage after compaction retains an
explicit preview state.
